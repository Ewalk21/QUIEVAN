\begin{theorem}[3.24 Bolzano-Weierstrass]
If a bounded set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ contains infinitely many points, then there is at least one point in $\mathbb{R}^n$ which is an accumulation point of $S$.
%Application: Thm. 3.25 Cantor Intersection Theorem
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
(Case $n=1$,$\quad \mathbb{R}^{1}$)
Let $S \subset \mathbb{R}^{1}$ and $S$ bounded, $\Rightarrow$ since $S$ is bounded, $S$ lies completely within an interval $[a,b]$. Since $S$ contains infinitely many points,
$$[a,\frac{a+b}{2}] \quad \textrm{ and }  \quad [\frac{a+b}{2},b]$$
may either both contain infinitely many points or only one contains infinitely many points. Now define $[a_{1},b_{1}]$ to be one of the previously stated intervals with infinitely many points. Then
$$[a_{1},\frac{a_{1}+b_{1}}{2}] \quad \textrm{ and }  \quad [\frac{a_{1}+b_{1}}{2},b_{1}]$$
again may either both contain infinitely many points or only one contains infinitely many points. Repeating this process $k$ times, we arrive at an interval $[a_{k},b_{k}]$
such that $$sup(a_{k}) = inf(b_{k}) = x$$ where $x \in S$. We aim to show that $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$. Consider $k$ to be large enough such that $b_{k} - a_{k} < \frac{r}{2}$, $\Rightarrow [a_{k},b_{k}] \subseteq B(x,r)$. Since, by construction, $B(x,r)$ contains infinitely many points, $(B(x,r) - \{x\}) \cap S \ne \emptyset$ and hence $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$.
\newline{}
\newline{}
(Case $n=2$,$\quad \mathbb{R}^{2}$) Let $S \subset \mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $S$ bounded, $\Rightarrow$ since $S$ is bounded, $S$ lies completely within a 2-dimensional interval $J$ defined by the cartesian product of two 1-dimensional intervals.
$$J_{1} = [a,b] \times [a,b]$$
similar to the case for $n=1$ above, we continually divide the interval into halfs, choosing the interval with infinitely many points. Let $I_{1}^{(1)} = [a,b]$, and $I_{2}^{(1)} = [a,b]$, Then let the next division of the interval be $I_{1}^{(2)} = [a,\frac{a+b}{2}] \textrm{ or } [\frac{a+b}{2},b] = [a_{1},b_{1}]$, and $I_{2}^{(2)} = [a,\frac{a+b}{2}] \textrm{ or } [\frac{a+b}{2},b] = [a_{2},b_{2}]$, Again choosing whichever interval has infinitely many points. If they both contain infinitely many points, our choice is arbitrary. Hence, define $J_{n} = I_{1}^{n} \times I_{2}^{n}$. For a large enough $n$, we have that $J_{n}$ has the property that
$$sup(a_{1}^{(n)}) = inf(b_{1}^{(n)}) = x_{1} \quad \textrm{ and } \quad sup(a_{2}^{(n)}) = inf(b_{2}^{(n)}) = x_{2}$$
We assert that $x=(x_{1}, x_{2})$ is an accumulation point of $S$. Note that $b_{k}^{(n)}-a_{k}^{(n)} = \frac{a}{2^{n-2}}$ for $k = 1,2$. take a ball in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, $B(x,r)$ and let n be large enough such that $\frac{a}{2^{n-2}} < \frac{r}{2}$. Hence $J_{n} \subseteq B(x,r)$, $\Rightarrow$ $B(x,r)$ also contains infinitely many points and we have that,
$$ (B(x,r)- \{x\}) \cap S \ne \emptyset $$
This proves that $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$.



\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}[3.27] \nonumber
Let $G = \{A_{1},A_{2},...\}$ denote the countable collection of all n-balls having rational radii and centers at points with rational coordinates. Assume $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and let $S$ be an open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $x \in S$. Then $x \in A_{k} \subseteq S$ for some $k$. That is, $x$ is contained by some n-ball in $G$ which is contained by $S$.
%Application: Thm 3.28 (Lindeloff Covering Theorem)
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Theorem 2.27 states that if G is a countable collection of countable sets, then
\[\cup_{k=1}^{n} A_{k} \qquad A_{k} \in G\]
is also countable. Since $x \in S$, and $S$ is open, we know that there exists an n-ball such that
\[B(x,r) \subseteq S\]
We want to find a rational point $y\in S$ such that $x \in B(y,R) \in G$, or equally stated by $B(y,R) \subseteq B(x,r) \subseteq S$. Let
$x=(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})$ and let $y_{k}$ be a rational number such that
\[\left| y_{k} - x_{k} \right| < \frac{r}{4n} \qquad \textrm{ for each } k=1,2,3,...,n\]
Then
\[\|y-x\| \leq \mid y_{1}-x_{1} \mid + ... + \mid y_{n}-x_{n} \mid < \frac{r}{4}\]
Let us define $R$ as a rational number such that $\frac{r}{4} < R < \frac{r}{2}$. Then
$x \in B(y,R)$ since we found the distance between $y$ and $x$ to be less than $r/4$, so surely $x$ must be contained in $B(y,R)$. By the same reasoning, we have that $B(y,R) \subseteq B(x,r) \subseteq S$. since both $y$ and $R$ are rational by construction, we have that $B(y,R) \in G$. Hence, we've proved the assertion.
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}[3.29 Heine-Borel]
Let $F$ be an open covering of a closed and bounded set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$. Then a finite subcollection of $F$ also covers $A$.

The next 3 theorems are with respect to problem 5.
\begin{theorem}[theorem 4.16]
Let $f:S \to T$  be a function from one metric space $(S,d_{S})$ to another $(T,d_{T})$, and assume $p \in S$. Then $f$ is continuous at $p$ iff for every sequence $\{x_{n}\}$ in $S$ convergent to $p$, the sequence $\{f(x_{n})\}$ in $T$ converges to $f(p)$. Symbolically,
\[\lim_{n \to \infty} f(x_{n}) = f(\lim_{n \to \infty} x_{n})\]
%Continuous Functions in Metric Spaces: Thm. 4.16, Thm. 4.23, Thm. 4.25
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
($\Longrightarrow$) Assume that $f$ is continuous at $p$. The definition of continuity at a point states that for every $\epsilon > 0$ there is a $\delta >0$ such that,
\[d_{T}(f(x),f(p)) < \delta \qquad \textrm{  whenever  } d_{S}(x,p) < \delta\]
And if every sequence $\{x_{n}\} \rightarrow p$ in $S$, then  $\forall \delta > 0 \quad \exists N$ s.t. $$d_{S}(x_{n},p) < \delta, \qquad \textrm{ whenever } n \geq N$$
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[theorem 4.23]
Let $f:S \to T$  be a function from one metric space $(S,d_{S})$ to another $(T,d_{T})$. Then $f$ is continuous on $S$ iff for every open set $Y$ in $T$, the inverse image $f^{-1}(Y)$ is open on $S$.
%Continuous Functions in Metric Spaces: Thm. 4.16, Thm. 4.23, Thm. 4.25
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
($\Longrightarrow$) Assume $Y$ is open and $f$ is continuous, Since $Y$ is open we have that $B_{T}(y,\epsilon) \subseteq Y$ for some $\epsilon > 0$. Let $p \in f^{-1}(Y)$ and $y=f(p)$, And Since $f$ is continuous on $S$ we have that $f$ is continuous at $p$ and hence $\exists \delta > 0$ such that  $f(B_{S}(p,\delta)) \subseteq B_{T}(y,\epsilon)$. Hence,
\[B_{S}(p,\delta) \subseteq f^{-1}[f(B_{S}(p,\delta))] \subseteq f^{-1}[B_{T}(y,\epsilon)] \subseteq f^{-1}(Y)\]
Then $p$ is an interior point of $f^{-1}(Y)$ and by Definition 3.6, if a set contains all its interior points then it is open, and since $p$ can be any point in $f^{-1}(Y)$ we have that $f^{-1}(Y)$ contains all its interior points and hence is open.
\newline{}
($\Longleftarrow$) Conversely, assume $f^{-1}(Y)$ is open in $S$ for every open subset set $Y$ in $T$. Take $p \in S$ and again let $y=f(p)$, then we want to show $f$ is continuous at $p$. $\forall \epsilon > 0$, $B_{T}(y,\epsilon)$ is open in $T$, hence $f^{-1}(B_{T}(y,\epsilon))$ is open in $S$. Since $f^{-1}(y) = p$ ,  $p \in f^{-1}(B_{T}(y,\epsilon))$, then $\exists \delta > 0$ such that,
\[B_{S}(p,\delta) \subseteq f^{-1}(B_{T}(y,\epsilon)) \Rightarrow f(B_{S}(p,\delta)) \subseteq B_{T}(y,\epsilon)\]
By definition 4.15, a function $f$ is continuous at $p$ iff $\forall \epsilon > 0, \quad \exists \delta > 0$ such that $ f(B_{S}(p,\delta)) \subseteq B_{T}(f(p),\epsilon)$, and hence we have that $f$ is continuous at $p$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[theorem 4.25]
Let $f:S \to T$  be a function from one metric space $(S,d_{S})$ to another $(T,d_{T})$. If $f$ is continuous on compact subset $X$ of $S$, then the image $f(X)$ is a compact subset of $T$; in particular, $f(X)$ is closed and bounded in $T$.
%Continuous Functions in Metric Spaces: Thm. 4.16, Thm. 4.23, Thm. 4.25
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}[Uniform Continuity Thm. 4.47 (Heine)]
Let $f:S \to T$ be a function from one metric space $(S,d_{S})$ to another $(T,d_{T})$. Let $A$ be a compact subset of $S$ and assume that $f$ is continuous on $A$. Then $f$ is uniformly continuous on $A$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}[Thm 5.10 (Rolle) and Thm 5.12 (Generalized Mean Value)]
Let $f$ and $g$ be two functions, each having a derivative (finite or infinite) at each point
of an open interval $(a,b)$ and each continuous at the endpoints $a$ and $b$. if $f(a)=f(b)$, then there is at least one interior point c at which
\[f^\prime(c) = 0\]
Now assume also that there is no interior point $x$ at which both $f^\prime(x)$ and $g^\prime(x)$ are infinite. Then for some interior point $c$ we have
\[f^\prime(c)[g(b)-g(a)] = g^\prime(c)[f(b)-f(a)]\]
%Application: Thm 5.11
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
%proof for rolles

%proof for 5.12
Let $h(x) = f(x)[g(b) - g(a)] - g(x)[f(b) - f(a)]$. Since $h(x)$ is a linear combination of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, $h(x)$ inherits many of the assumptions about $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, which is exactly what we want in order to use Rolle's theorem. Note that,
\begin{align*}
$h(a)$ &= $ f(a)[g(b) - g(a)] - g(a)[f(b) - f(a)]$
\\ &= $ f(a)g(b) - g(a)f(b)$
\\ &= $ - f(b)g(a) + g(b)f(a)$
\\ &= $ f(b)[g(b) - g(a)] - g(b)[f(b) - f(a)]$
\\ &= $ h(b)$
\end{align*}
So $h(a) = h(b)$, $ \Rightarrow $ by Rolle's theorem we have that $\exists $ $c$ such that $ h^\prime(c) = 0 $. And Hence,
\[h^\prime(c) = f^\prime(c)[g(b) - g(a)] - g^\prime(c)[f(b) - f(a)] = 0\]
$ \Rightarrow $
\[f^\prime(c)[g(b)-g(a)] = g^\prime(c)[f(b)-f(a)]\]
This proves the assertion.
\end{proof}

The following three proofs are with respect to problem 8
\begin{theorem}[7.8]
Assume $f \in R(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$ and assume that $\alpha$ has a continuous derivative $\alpha^\prime$ on $[a,b]$. Then the Riemann integral $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \alpha^\prime(x)dx$ exists and we have

and

Let $f$ be defined on $[a,b]$ in such a way that at least one of the functions $f$ or $\alpha$ is continuous from the left at $c$ and at least one is continuous from the right at $c$. Then $f \in R(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$ and we have

for $k=1,2,...,n$, and $f(0) = 0$. Then
\[\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{k} = \sum_{k=1}^{n}f(k) = \int_{0}^{n}f(x)d[x]\]

\[\int_{a}^{b}f(x)d\alpha(x) = c\int_{a}^{b}d\alpha(x) = c[\alpha(a)-\alpha(b)]\]
